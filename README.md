# Credit Risk Analysis with MongoDB Data

## Overview
This project implements a complete credit risk analysis pipeline powered by Python and MongoDB. The pipeline covers data ingestion from MongoDB, feature selection, model training using XGBoost, and serving predictions via a Flask REST API.

The goal is to predict the likelihood of credit default for loan applicants using machine learning techniques, while demonstrating data handling with MongoDB and a scalable deployment approach.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Ingestion:** Pull data directly from MongoDB using `pymongo`.
- **Feature Engineering and Selection:** Utilize RandomForest for automatic feature importance.
- **Modeling:** Train explainable and accurate models on credit risk datasets with XGBoost.
- **API Serving:** Easy-to-use Flask API enabling integration into downstream applications or microservices.
- **Modular Code Design:** Separation of concerns for easier maintenance and expansion.
